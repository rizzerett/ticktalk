# TICKTALK INFO

Jacob, I wasn't able to set up the placeholders, bg and sound-effects properly because of how scuffed ren'py can actually be, so let me just fill you in what to do.

1. Character Images
- Obviously you would just want to have a set of characters for the roster, I honestly think you can lightwork this and not go too fancy on the drawings.
- While the expressions are important, I don't want you to die so goodluck.

2. Audio and Images
- Just rob it somewhere from a non-copyright sourced area (YT, StockWebsites, IDC)

3. GUI/UIX
- You CAN edit the UI/GUI (afaik, it's just additional art and editing needed.)
- Options are also editable too, as well as the resolution so take that to note.

The code is REALLLY easy to understand (I didnt use any fancy point-click anymore since that was just a waste of time.
